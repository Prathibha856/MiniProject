cd F:\MiniProject
.\start_fare_service.ps1
```

Or manually:

npm start
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

âœ… **Frontend is now running!**

2. You should see: **"Live GTFS Data Active"** indicator (green)
3. Try these test routes:

**Test Route 1:**

- Expected Fare: â‚¹10-15

**Test Route 2:**
- From: `Whitefield`

## Troubleshooting

### "Using Estimated Fares" showing instead of "Live GTFS Data"

**Problem:** Backend is not connected

**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend is running: `http://localhost:5001/api/fare/health`
2. Check for port conflicts
3. Restart both backend and frontend

### Backend won't start

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError`

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ml
pip install flask flask-cors pandas numpy
```

### No search suggestions appearing

**Problem:** GTFS data not loaded

**Solution:**
1. Verify files exist: `ml\dataset\gtfs\fare_attributes.txt`
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Restart backend service

---

## Verify Everything Works

Run the test suite:

```bash
cd ml
python test_fare_service.py
```

You should see:
```
ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Your fare calculator is working perfectly!
```

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes?

1. **Backend loads GTFS data** from `ml/dataset/gtfs/`
   - 62 fare types (â‚¹5 to â‚¹315)
   - 7,000+ bus stops
   - 190,000+ fare rules
   - 2,000+ routes

2. **Frontend connects** to backend API

3. **User searches stops** â†’ Backend returns real GTFS stop names

4. **User calculates fare** â†’ Backend:
   - Finds stop IDs from `stops.txt`
   - Matches route in `fare_rules.txt`
   - Gets price from `fare_attributes.txt`
   - Adds GST and returns accurate fare
