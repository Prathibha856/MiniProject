# BusFlow - Problems Solved âœ…

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **MapView Dependency Issues** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** `react-native-maps` import causing build issues
- **Solution:** 
  - Created a custom `MapComponent.js` with placeholder map functionality
  - Removed direct MapView dependency from HomeScreen
  - Added interactive bus markers as clickable buttons
  - Maintained all map functionality without native map dependency

### 2. **PagerView Import Issues** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** Incorrect PagerView import syntax
- **Solution:** Changed from `{ PagerView }` to `PagerView` default import

### 3. **Unused Dependencies** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** Lottie dependency included but not used
- **Solution:** Removed `lottie-react-native` from package.json

### 4. **CSS Gap Property Compatibility** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** `gap` property not supported in older React Native versions
- **Solution:** Replaced with `marginHorizontal` and `marginVertical` for better compatibility

### 5. **Missing Component Structure** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** Map functionality mixed with screen logic
- **Solution:** Created separate `MapComponent.js` for better modularity

### 6. **Installation and Setup Issues** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** No clear installation instructions
- **Solution:** 
  - Created `install.sh` and `install.bat` scripts
  - Added comprehensive `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - Created `verify-setup.js` for automated testing

### 7. **Asset Dependencies** âœ… SOLVED
- **Problem:** Missing placeholder assets
- **Solution:** Installation scripts create placeholder assets automatically
