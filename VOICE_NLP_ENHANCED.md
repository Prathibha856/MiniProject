# 🧠 Voice Assistant with NLP - ENHANCED VERSION

## ✨ What's New?

I've upgraded your voice assistant from **simple keyword matching** to **advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP)**!

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **Before (Basic Keyword Matching):**
```
User: "track"  → Works ✅
User: "I want to track a bus"  → Failed ❌
User: "where is my bus"  → Failed ❌
User: "find bus 335E"  → Failed ❌
```

### **After (Advanced NLP):**
```
User: "track"  → Works ✅
User: "I want to track a bus"  → Works ✅
User: "where is my bus"  → Works ✅
User: "find bus 335E"  → Works ✅ (Also extracts "335E"!)
User: "show me bus tracking"  → Works ✅
User: "locate a bus"  → Works ✅
```

---

## 🧠 NLP Features Implemented

### **1. Intent Recognition with Confidence Scoring**
- Uses **Levenshtein distance** for similarity matching
- Scores multiple intent candidates
- Returns **confidence percentage** (0-100%)
- Threshold: 30% minimum confidence

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: "I want to check crowd prediction"
Output: {
  intent: 'crowd',
  confidence: 0.87,  // 87% confidence
  entities: {}
}
```

### **2. Fuzzy Phrase Matching**
- Matches variations and misspellings
- Understands natural language phrases
- Not just exact keywords

**Understands:**
```
"track a bus"
"track bus"
"find bus"
"where is the bus"
"show me bus location"
"bus tracking"
"locate bus"
```

### **3. Entity Extraction**
Automatically extracts:
- **Bus numbers** (335E, 500D, 298, etc.)
- **Locations** (origin, destination)
- **Routes**

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: "track bus 335E"
Output: {
  intent: 'track',
  confidence: 0.92,
  entities: {
    busNumber: '335E'  // ← Extracted!
  }
}
```

### **4. Multi-Language NLP**
Works with natural phrases in:
- **English** ✅
- **Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ)** ✅
- **Hindi (हिंदी)** ✅

**Example (Kannada):**
```
"ಬಸ್ ಹುಡುಕಿ" (Find bus) → track intent
"ಪ್ರಯಾಣ ಯೋಜನೆ ಮಾಡಿ" (Plan journey) → journey intent
"ಜನಸಂದಣಿ ತಿಳಿಯಬೇಕು" (Want to know crowd) → crowd intent
```

### **5. Context-Aware Responses**
Personalized responses based on extracted entities:

```javascript
// Without entity
Input: "track bus"
Response: "Opening bus tracking"

// With entity
Input: "track bus 335E"
Response: "Opening bus tracking for bus 335E"  // ← Personalized!
```

### **6. Advanced Pattern Recognition**
Recognizes 10 intents with 100+ phrase variations:
- **track** - 20+ variations
- **journey** - 18+ variations
- **crowd** - 15+ variations
- **fare** - 12+ variations
- **timetable** - 14+ variations
- **search** - 10+ variations
- **around** - 8+ variations
- **about** - 8+ variations
- **feedback** - 6+ variations
- **help** - 8+ variations

## 📊 NLP Algorithm Details

### **Step 1: Text Normalization**
```javascript
Input: "I WANT TO Track A Bus 335E"
Normalized: "i want to track a bus 335e"
```

### **Step 2: Phrase Matching (High Priority)**
```javascript
Phrases: ['track a bus', 'track bus', 'find bus', ...]
Similarity Score: Uses Levenshtein distance
Match: "i want to track a bus" ≈ "track a bus" (similarity: 0.75)
```

### **Step 3: Keyword Matching (Medium Priority)**
```javascript
Keywords: ['track', 'find', 'where', 'locate', ...]
Matches: ['track', 'bus']
```

### **Step 4: Intent Scoring**
```javascript
Score Calculation:
- Phrase match (similarity > 0.7): +10 points × similarity
- Phrase contained: +8 points
- Keyword match: +5 points each
- Normalized by pattern count: score / √(keywords + phrases)
```

### **Step 5: Best Intent Selection**
```javascript
Scores: {
  track: 8.5,
  journey: 2.1,
  search: 1.8
}
Best: 'track' with 85% confidence
```

### **Step 6: Entity Extraction**
```javascript
Bus Number Pattern: /\b(\d{1,4}[a-z]{0,2})\b/i
Extracted: '335E'

Location Pattern: /from\s+([a-z\s]+)\s+to\s+([a-z\s]+)/i
Extracted: {origin: 'Majestic', destination: 'Kadugodi'}
```

## 🎯 How It Works (User Perspective)

### **Example 1: Simple Command**
```
User clicks mic → 🎤
App: "Listening..."
User: "track bus"
App: 🧠 NLP Analysis
     Intent: track (92% confidence)
     Entities: {}
App: 🔊 "Opening bus tracking"
→ Navigates to Track Bus page ✅
```

### **Example 2: Complex Command**
```
User clicks mic → 🎤
App: "Listening..."
User: "I want to find bus 335E"
App: 🧠 NLP Analysis
     Intent: track (87% confidence)
     Entities: {busNumber: '335E'}
App: 🔊 "Opening bus tracking for bus 335E"
→ Navigates to Track Bus page ✅
Console shows: Bus number extracted: 335E
```

### **Example 3: Unclear Command**
```
User clicks mic → 🎤
App: "Listening..."
User: "something random"
App: 🧠 NLP Analysis
     Intent: null (12% confidence - too low!)
App: 🔊 "I didn't quite understand that. Try saying: 
     'track bus', 'journey planner', 'crowd prediction'..."
→ Gives helpful suggestions ✅
```

## 📈 Confidence Threshold

The system uses a **30% confidence threshold**:

| Confidence | Action |
|-----------|---------|
| 0-30% | ❌ Reject, ask for clarification |
| 30-60% | ⚠️ Accept with low confidence |
| 60-80% | ✅ Good match |
| 80-100% | ✅✅ Excellent match |
